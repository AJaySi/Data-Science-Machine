create mapping between column and available stats on it

enum --> count
float --> avg, std
text --> length, topic model???


do decile for all rows and all rows with similar foreign key


do something around finding the user table


Good ideas:
- propose prediction problems
- explain factors leading to label
- 


Automate data science pipeline

Preprocessing --> Feature Engineering --> Modeling --> Validation/Insights

	- Automatic feature generation from an exisiting database
	- my approach is modeled after how a data scientist works
	- it can cuts down on repeat work
	- insights can be deeper












# func.std(column).label('std.'+label),
# func.max(column).label('max.'+label),
# func.min(column).label('min.'+label),
# func.sum(column).label('sum.'+label),
# func.count(column).label('count.'+label),


# shopify add on



- fixed infinite loop issue while making features
- put some code in place to excluded certain functions based on column type
- made parameter to limit number of funcs applied
- changed column notation so it is easier to read what functions were applied
- reorganized classes and broke code into separate files
